# Simple Vue.js Web App Using Typescript

A very simple web app using Vue.js and Typescript. Its a Hello World! app, but the use can change "World" to whatever they want via a text box below. They can also add and remove exclamation marks.

While this app is simple, I built it get more familar with both Typescript and Vue.js, both of which are extremely fun to play with. 

I found this exercise <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/samples/">here</a>. I'll probably play around with the other ones at some point.
